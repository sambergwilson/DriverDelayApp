# DriverDelayApp: My First .NET MAUI Application

I developed this application a while back but neglected to push it to my GitHub repository.

## Technology Stack:
- C# & .NET MAUI

This project is a straightforward mobile application designed to calculate time differences between drive times, time paid, stop times, and stop time paid.

Drawing upon my two decades of experience with a trucking company, I aimed to address a common challenge faced by driversâ€”calculating delay times for which the company compensates them.

While the app may not boast intricate features, its purpose is rooted in practicality, providing a tool that could have benefited many drivers throughout my career.
